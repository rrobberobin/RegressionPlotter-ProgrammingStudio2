My progression so far

Three classes have been created. "Regression" and "Testing" classes have content, while "FileInput" is empty. 

The Regression class is done for now. It receives an array of data and converts it into the resulting regression function. 
It returns the function as a string. I will later have to see in which form the function should be returned. 
The class basically takes care of all the mathematics needed for the regression. 

My testing class's first test is done. It tests the central functionality of the regression class, the "linear" method. It will still have to be expanded. 
It includes a "main" function, for testing purposes. The linear method returns a string of the regression function. E.g. y=5x+6.

Some comments have been added to my code in class Regression and Testing

Problems in the start have been: 
Making the generic project made in git a scala project. Importing libraries and jars. 
At the moment trying to import the swing library.
Some minor technical problems in implementing the regression, but those have been resolved.

The weekly exercises ended last week and after that I started with the project. I'm roughly at the pace that I was expecting. 
There have been many things to do to get the project started, like doing research and solving technical difficulties. 
Workload ~15 hours

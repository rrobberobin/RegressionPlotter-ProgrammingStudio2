Progress

Class "FileInput" is able to handle csv data now in a very specific format. I managed to remove the bug which prevented the file handling.
The "Testing" object has been updated correspondigly and the tests for FileInput are working. 
Created a couple of csv data files for testing as well.

I managed to create some small things in Swing, so it's working. But I don't think I can make graphs with swing.
That's why it's crucial to get ScalaFX working. After importing ScalaFX, I tried using it, but I'm having problems creating anything.
Getting this error:
â—¾Symbol 'type <none>.event.EventTarget' is missing from the classpath. 
This symbol is required by 'class scalafx.stage.Window'. 
Make sure that type EventTarget is in your classpath and check for conflicting dependencies with -Ylog-classpath. 
A full rebuild may help if 'Window.class' was compiled against an incompatible version of <none>.event.

Most of my time has gone to solving problems which pop up everywhere and researching how to solve them. 
Much less time has gone to actually getting anything done.

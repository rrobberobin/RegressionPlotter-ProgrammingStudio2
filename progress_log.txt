Progress

Class "FileInput" is able to handle csv data now in a very specific format. I managed to remove the bug which prevented the file handling.
The "Testing" object has been updated correspondigly and the tests for FileInput are working. 
Created a couple of csv data files for testing as well.

I managed to create some small things in Swing, so it's working. But I don't think I can make graphs with swing.
That's why it's crucial to get ScalaFX working. After a whole lot of help from the staff, I got ScalaFX to work. The problem was adoptopenjdk.

Most of my time has gone to solving problems which pop up everywhere and researching how to solve them. 
Much less time has gone to actually getting anything done.

Workload ~40 hours

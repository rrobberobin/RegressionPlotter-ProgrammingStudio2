My 2 week progression

Class "FileInput" has been properly started now and it is used for reading data from files. It should now somewhat be able to read data, 
but there is some bug that makes unwanted changes when returning the data. When that bug is cleared, 
my next step will be to make it take the CSV format into account.
The "Testing" object has been updated correspondigly, to test the FileInput.
SwingTestObject has been created but it is empty.

The regression class still works as before. FileInpout works partially. Both have been tested.

I believe I have resolved the problems with importing libraries and have succesfully imported swing, scalaFX and O1Library. Only time will tell for sure...
Most of the my time has gone to research and solving technical difficulties. Much less time to actually writing code.

My other courses have taken a lot of time and I haven't been able to work at the project as much as I had hoped, but I'm still progressing forward.
Workload ~15 hours
